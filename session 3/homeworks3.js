    Exercise: Banking System
    In this exercise, you'll create a simplified banking system using Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.
    In our bank, we have two types of Accounts.
    
    - SavingAccount:
        properties: accountNumber, accountHolder, balance, interestRate, wage
        methods:
        - getInfo: which prints account type and account information
        - getBalance: which prints the current balance
        - deposit: which takes an amount and adds it to the balance
        - withdraw: which takes an amount and subtracts the amount + wage from the balance.
            (if the current balance is higher than or equal to the amount + wage)
        - getInterest: which prints interestRate multiplied by the balance
    
    - NormalAccount:        
        properties: accountNumber, accountHolder, balance, dailyLimit
        methods:
        - getInfo: which prints account type and account information
        - getBalance: which prints the current balance
        - deposit: which takes an amount and adds it to the balance
        - withdraw: which takes an amount and subtracts it from the balance
        - getDailyLimit: which prints the account dailyLimit (no calculation required)
        
    
    You need to think and implement this bank in the best way you can.
    You just need to define the classes. no further implementation is required.
